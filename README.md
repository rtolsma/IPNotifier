# IPNotifier
This program is meant to notify you when your dynamic IP has changed. I created this project out of neccessity because I host multiple portforwarded services out of my own residence, and needed to know my IP at all times.
To run this program, download the jar and in Terminal/Command Prompt run 'java -jar IPNotifier yourEmail@gmail.com yourEmailPassword recipient@gmail.com your.smtp.host'
The smtp host argument for GMail users should be "smtp.gmail.com". Have this program run with those arguments on computer startup to ensure consistency.
